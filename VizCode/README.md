* The viz2 python script flattens the json file for visualization purpose

* it displays a 3d scatter plot of animal coordinates through time (xcoord, ycoord, time)

* we color code the type of animal (zebra, elephant, lion), but we did not color code each individual animal

* due to large amount of record, we suggest you change line 50, or add filtering, to limit the data displayed
